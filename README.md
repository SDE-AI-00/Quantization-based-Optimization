This repository contains the testbench for quantization-based optimization (QTZ). We provide three testbench codes:

ml_test_anonymopus: Testbench for QTZ applied to machine learning tasks.
nlp_test_anonymopus: Testbench for QTZ applied to continuous nonlinear optimization problems.
tsp_test_anonymopus: Testbench for QTZ applied to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and low-dimensional optimization tasks.

Each folder includes a "README.md" file describing the usage and details of the corresponding code.
